Employee Management:

Add Employee: Input employee details using a form.
View Employees: See a list of all employees stored in the system.
Edit Employee: Update employee information.
Delete Employee: Remove employees from the system.
Data Storage:

Employee data is stored in a text file (employee.txt).
User credentials are stored in a JSON file (users.json).
Frontend:

Clean and responsive interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Smooth transitions and animations between login and signup forms.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express.js: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
